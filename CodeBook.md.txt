1. The result data is clean_data.csv
2. It has 174 columns listed in the file "List_of_columns.txt"
3. These column names are suffixed by either .sd or .men
4. The columns ending with .sd have the standard deviation for the variable, by activity and by subject.

For example: The column tBodyGyro-std()-X.sd has standard deviation for feature tBodyGyro-std()-X by activity and by subject

5. The columns ending with .men have the average for the variable, by activity and by subject.

For example: The column tBodyGyro-std()-X.men has average for feature tBodyGyro-std()-X by activity and by subject

5. Data in clean_data.csv is a result of:

a. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.

b. Extract of the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 
c. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

d. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

e. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

I have also calculated the std deviation for the features.
